My website presents my portfolio and inspirations as well as giving visitors access to different platforms where they can view my current work. The aim is to make a mark online where people can easily find me and contact me. 


### INSPIRATION ###

I have always been interested in Bauhaus, 20th Century Avant-Garde, Architecture and Modernism. Due to the fact that next year 2019 we will be celebrating 100 years of Bauhaus School of Art in Weimar, Germany my portfolio is a small tribute to those design principles that are still present and considered modern even 100 years later. 

- colors
    - Original colors were inspired by 20th century bauhaus and avant-garde movements. The final choice of the color pallette has been a result of trying different schemes. The original prime colors used in avant-garde were a lot stronger and intesnse. It is due to the fact that the message channelled through these in the last 100 years was very often political, with the aim of stripping art of its current layout and design standards. They needed to create new abstract forms. My final choice is meant to be a lot more contemporary and friendly. The portfolio is meant to be minimalistic however pragmatic and inviting. 

- design
    - the chosem theme required from me consistenty. I didn't want to copy any bauhaus or avant-garde art that you can find online however I wanted to pass on my own, contemporary version of it. The abstract element of the "canvas" are usable and practical through active links and smooth css stying

### CHALLENGES ###

The main challenge with the design was to stay truthful to the original concepts and principles of bauhaus/avant-garde however be able to recereate a modern, slick, minimalist design that will be easy and friendly to read. 

The technical challenge is to create all the elements of the slick design using css only. My passion for responsive design requires from me a strick regime while deisgning the layout and choosing humbe css solutions.    

### FONTS ###

I have decided to use Sans-Serif fonts due to their modest looks. I ended up with hero font of "Bauhaus" which is used only on the landing page for my name. The other 2 supporting fronts are "Ubuntu: thin" for titles/headers and "Lato: Thin" for content. Based on my reserach they complement each other very well and using "Bauhaus" make a strong enough contribution to the theme. 

### LOGO ###

I have considered multiple options for a simple clean logo evolving around my initials "EG". I was toying with the idea of using both small caps letters, mix of downcase and uppercase, and only uppercase. I ended up with , in my opinion , the cleanest downcase "EG" with 3 dots on the right hand side and a square bracket as a base for the logo.
